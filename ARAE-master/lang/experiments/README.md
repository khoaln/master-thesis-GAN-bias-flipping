# vector.py

An experiment to try to change the content of a sentence based my modifying the
latent variable z. The alteration is done by sampling sentences from a fixed
z, then updating towards the mean of the desired feature. We do this repeatedly
until the argmax generation has the correct feature.


## Requirements

* spacy

1) Generate 1M sample sentences with vectors and features

> python -m experiments.vector gen --dump  features.pkl --load_path maxlen15

2) Attempt to alter new sentences based on the mean vector of `VERB_standingssss` sentences.

> python -m experiments.vector alter --dump  features.pkl --alter VERB_standing --load_path maxlen15
